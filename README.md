Bootstrap dropdowns that work on iOS and Android

The dropdowns in Bootstrap 2.1 don't work on iOS or Android.  There are some fixed to get them working in iOS, but Android seems to
be trickier.  These menus are simpler, but they just work.

See the example page for usage.  It's basically the same as with Bootstrap's menus, except with an sm- prefix.  Submenus are not supported.
